# ToolBox-ComputerVision

This was a school assignment I made for my Olin class, Software Design in the fall of 2018.

More information and instructions can be found on [the toolbox page](https://sd18fall.github.io/toolboxes/image-processing).

## Content
The script draws an empty square round a face. 
I also added boxes in front of the eyes and the mouth. The ratio and the position of those squares is linked to the big squares.

## Example
This picture shows the result:
